## Why Blockchains?

1. **Currency Issues**

   - Inflating Currencies: Central banks can print more money, leading to inflation
   - Random Bailouts: Governments bail out failing institutions, creating unfair conditions
   - Currency Depreciation: Traditional currencies lose value over time
   - Lack of Backing: Modern currencies not backed by tangible assets

2. **Banking Issues**
   - Fractional Reserve Banking: Banks only keep a fraction of depositors' money
   - Need for Better Currency: Requirements for open, transparent, inflation-immune currency

> **Recommended**: Watch "The Big Short" for insight into financial crises

## What is Blockchain?

A decentralized and distributed digital ledger that records transactions across many computers.

### Main Characteristics

1. **Decentralization**

   - Managed across multiple nodes
   - No single controlling entity
   - Each node stores entire blockchain

2. **Immutability**

   - Records cannot be easily altered/deleted
   - Ensures data integrity

3. **Transparency**

   - All transactions visible to participants
   - Promotes trust and openness

4. **Consensus Mechanisms**
   - Nodes validate transactions
   - Uses methods like PoW, PoS

### Purpose

- Create network of computers agreeing on common state
- Allow open participation
- Prevent single-entity control

## Creating New Currency with Blockchain

### Key Points

1. **Avoiding Central Ownership**

   - Prevents power misuse
   - Distributes control

2. **Trustless System**

   - No central authority needed
   - Consensus-based verification

3. **Anonymization**

   - Private transactions
   - System transparency maintained

4. **Decentralization**
   - Network of nodes
   - Reduced manipulation risk

## Technical Concepts

### Hashing

**Properties:**

- Deterministic output
- Fast computation
- Pre-image resistance
- Collision resistance
- Sensitive to input changes

**Tool:** [SHA256 Online Tool](https://emn178.github.io/online-tools/sha256.html)

#### Hashing vs. Encryption

| Hashing            | Encryption          |
| ------------------ | ------------------- |
| Fixed-size output  | Variable output     |
| One-way function   | Two-way function    |
| For data integrity | For confidentiality |

### Blockchain Components

1. **Blocks**

   - Transaction lists
   - Timestamps
   - Previous block hash

2. **Nonce**

   - Unique number for valid hash
   - Used in mining process
   - Critical for PoW

3. **Mining**

   - Block production
   - Compute power correlation
   - Nonce calculation

4. **Consensus Mechanism**
   - Network agreement method
   - Transaction validation rules
   - Proof of Work (PoW) implementation
